# Suckless Software builds.

This repo contains my builds of:
- DWM - The suckless window manager
- DWMBlocks - Status bar and module scripts
- DMenu - For now, it is default

### DWM

A Very minimal build of dwm. Uses pywal colorscheme at [`colors-wal-dwm.h`](https://github.com/egujito/suckless-repos/blob/master/dwm/colors-wal-dwm.h), patched to remove Urgent color scheme.

***IMPORTANT***

Make sure you change everything in [`autostart.h`](https://github.com/egujito/suckless-repos/blob/master/dwm/autostart.sh) to fit your system
